Extract whole game and its files from zip file and then run.
This game is made using python and pygame. This game dosen't use any other rendering softwares of modules but, itselt calculate

If you face any problem running blockBrust.exe file then try running blockBrust27.pyc or blockBrust.cpython-36.pyc (compiled python file)
by installing python into your system.
